a set of precise and complete instructions to accomplish a task.
K
constant
N
null
data fields or local variables whose value cannot be modified.
K
data types
N
null
specifies the type of data that you work with in a program, defining the size of memory needed to store the data and the kinds of operations that can be performed on the data.
K
decision structures
N
null
introduce decision-making ability into a program, enabling you to branch to different sections of the code depending on the truth value of a Boolean expression.
K
decision table
N
null
a compact and readable format for presenting the algorithm.
K
default statement
N
null
used when an expression does not match any of the cases in a switch block.
K
do-while loop
N
null
repeatedly executes a block of statements until a specified Boolean expression evaluates to false, but tests the condition at the bottom of the loop.
K
exception
N
null
an error condition that occurs during the execution of a C# program.
K
finally block
N
null
used in association with the try block, and is always executed regardless of whether an exception is thrown; often used to write clean-up code.
K
flowchart
N
null
a graphical representation of an algorithm.
K
for loop
N
null
combines the three elements of iteration—the initialization expression, the termination condition expression, and the counting expression—into a more readable code.
K
foreach loop
N
null
useful for iterating through the elements of a collection.
K
high-level language
N
null
Languages such as C#, Visual Basic, or Java that allow you to write precise instructions in a human-readable form. 
K
if statement
N
null
executes a given sequence of statements only if the corresponding Boolean expression evaluates to true.
K
if-else statement
N
null
allows your program to perform one action if the Boolean expression evaluates to true and a different action if the Boolean expression evaluates to false.
K
methods
N
null
code blocks containing a series of statements, which can receive input via arguments and can return a value to the caller.
K
operator
N
null
a symbol that specifies which operation to perform on the operands before returning a result.
K
recursion
N
null
a programming technique that causes a method to call itself in order to compute a result.
K
switch block
N
null
can include one or more case statements or a default statement.
K
switch statement
N
null
allows multi-way branching, and, in many cases, it can simplify a complex combination of if-else statements.
K
try-catch-finally block
N
null
a code block that throws and handles exceptions to prevent program execution from terminating.
K
variable
N
null
temporary storage for values during the execution of a program.
K
while loop
N
null
repeatedly executes a block of statements until a specified Boolean expression evaluates to false.
M
Review the following code snippet:\nint n = 20;\nint d = n++ + 5;\nWhat will be the value of d after this code snippet is executed?
N
null
3
25
26
27
28
The answer is 25, since n is incremented only after the assignment (d = n + 5) is completed.
T
The switch statement selects for execution a statement list having an associated label that corresponds to the value of an expression.
N
null
false
The switch statement selects for execution a statement list having an associated label that corresponds to the value of an expression.
T
The if-else loop tests the condition at the bottom of the loop instead of at the top.
N
null
false
The do-while loop tests the condition at the bottom of the loop instead of at the top.
T
