Test Mate was born at a hotel bar in Singapore in 2006. Standardized testing became a part of my life when I joined the Marine Corps, and it seemed that every class and every inspection included a standardized test. Therefore, once I got my hands on a personal computer (over $2000 for a 386 in 1991!), I wrote a program that I could use to create my own practice tests. The first versions were written in BASICA with hard-coded data, but as time went on, I used different languages and added more features; such as a GUI; question-and-answer randomization; flat-file reading; and even wrote a version in dBase III that I used to print tests for my students while I was an instructor.

Eventually, while I was in the middle of the desert at Twentynine Palms, I began taking CLEP exams for college credit, and I used my as-of-yet unnamed program to study for these standardized tests. An education counselor asked me how I was achieving such high grades and I showed him the program. He told me I should take my show on the road, but I didn't give it serious thought until a few years later, when a ship I was on pulled into Singapore on my way back to California. Before I had left the States, I had purchased a XV6700 Pocket PC, and while I was walking through Singapore's Borders bookstore, I perused a book on .NET Compact Framework programming (BTW, Singapore is a technophile's dream). I didn't buy the book, but as I sat at the hotel bar waiting for friends, I decided I would attempt to port my program to my XV6700.

For many reasons, I never marketed Test Mate, but I continued to port it to different mobile operating systems, such as Apple's iOS (C++), the BlackBerry OS (Java), Palm's webOS (HTML/JavaScript), and my Android devices (which I still use to this day). Therefore, as one of my shared projects, I intend to write my version of Quizlet-before-Quizlet in JavaFX and Xamarin, and I hope you can get something out of it!
